# INF8953CE - Team Foo - Kaggle Competition

This work has been done for a Kaggle competition for the course INF8953CE, during fall of 2020 at
Polytechnic Montreal. The goal was to design a classification algorithm that can
automatically identify hand-drawn images. The dataset used is a variant of the google quick draw dataset with 31 classes.

## Code Requirements
You can create a new Conda environment to avoid having dependencies issues:
```
conda create -n yourenvironment python=3.8
conda activate yourenvironment
```
After that you can install all the needed packages by navigating to the source folder, opening the terminal, and running pip on the requirements.txt file:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then proceed to select this new environment as your jupyter notebook kernel.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a variant of the google quick draw dataset with 31 classes.
The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/f2020-INF8953CE/data).

## Python  Implementations:

### 1) Random Forest Classifier:

### 2) Network Used - Convolutional Neural Network: 

Please refer to the associated report for more information about our architecture. 
 
### Procedure

1) Get the dataset as mentioned above and place the `.npy` files in `/data` folder.
2) First, run `LoadData.py` which will load the data from the `/data` folder and store the features and labels in  pickel files.
3) Now you need to have the data, run `QD_trainer.py` which will load data from pickle and augment it. After this, the training process begins.
2) Now you need to have the data, run `QuickDrawApp.py` which will use use the webcam to get what you have drawn.
3) For altering the model, check `QD_trainer.py`.
4) For tensorboard visualization, go to the specific log directory and run this command ` tensorboard --logdir=.` You can go to `localhost:6006` for visualizing your loss function and accuracy.
